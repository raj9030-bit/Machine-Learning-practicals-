# ML Practical 1 – Linear Regression

---

## 📌 Overview

This practical focuses on the implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using **Python, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn**.

It covers the complete regression workflow, including **data preparation, model training, prediction, visualization, residual analysis, and model evaluation**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Implement **Simple Linear Regression** using NumPy.
* Implement Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn.
* Implement **Multiple Linear Regression**.
* Understand the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
* Visualize regression results using plots.
* Analyze prediction errors using residual plots.
* Evaluate model performance using **RMSE and R² Score**.

---

## 📚 Concepts Covered

### 1. Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression uses a **single independent variable** to predict a continuous dependent variable.

**Equation:**

`y = b₀ + b₁x`

**Where:**

* `y` → Predicted output
* `x` → Input feature
* `b₀` → Intercept
* `b₁` → Regression coefficient

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression uses **multiple independent variables** to predict a continuous target variable.

**Equation:**

`y = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ... + bₙxₙ`

---

## ⚙️ Implementation

The practical includes:

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature and target selection
* Train-test splitting
* Simple Linear Regression using NumPy
* Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Model prediction
* Regression line visualization
* Residual plot analysis
* Model performance evaluation

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

### RMSE – Root Mean Squared Error

RMSE measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.

**Lower RMSE indicates better prediction performance.**

### R² Score – Coefficient of Determination

R² Score indicates how well the regression model explains the variation in the target variable.

**A value closer to 1 generally indicates a better model fit.**

---

## 📈 Residual Analysis

Residuals represent the difference between actual and predicted values.

**Residual = Actual Value − Predicted Value**

A residual plot helps analyze whether the prediction errors are randomly distributed around zero and helps identify patterns in model errors.

# ML Practical 2 – Logistic Regression

---

## 📌 Overview

This practical demonstrates the implementation of **Logistic Regression** for **binary classification** using Python and Scikit-Learn.

The model predicts whether a user will **click on an advertisement** based on their online activity, using **Daily Time Spent on Site** and **Daily Internet Usage** as input features.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this practical is to understand and implement **Logistic Regression for binary classification**, make predictions, and evaluate the model using different classification evaluation techniques.

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

The practical follows a complete machine learning workflow:

### 1. Data Loading

The dataset is loaded using **Pandas** from the `advertising.csv` file.

Basic information about the dataset is explored, including:

* Dataset shape
* Column names
* Data types
* Missing values
* Statistical summary
* Target class distribution

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

**Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

The practical includes visualizations such as:

* Target class distribution
* Correlation heatmap
* Relationships between numerical features

### 3. Feature Selection

The following features are selected for model training:

**Input Features:**

* Daily Time Spent on Site
* Daily Internet Usage

**Target Variable:**

* Clicked on Ad

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

**StandardScaler** is applied to scale the input features.

### 4. Model Training

A **Logistic Regression** model from Scikit-Learn is trained using the scaled training data.

The trained model is used to generate:

* Predicted class labels
* Probability of advertisement clicks

### 5. Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the following classification metrics:

* **Accuracy**
* **Confusion Matrix**
* **Classification Report**
* **ROC Curve**
* **AUC Score**

These metrics help measure how effectively the model distinguishes between users who click and do not click on advertisements.

### 6. Visualization

The practical also includes visualization of:

* **Decision Boundary** – Shows how the selected features separate the two classes.
* **Sigmoid Function** – Demonstrates how Logistic Regression converts the linear output into a probability between 0 and 1.
